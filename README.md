# Responsive-website
My first responsive website, created as part of the JustCoding course.

JustCoding is a non-profit organization in Brisbane, committed to teaching people how to code. As part of this program I learned basic skills in html, css and javascript. The best way to learn is by putting things into practice and this responsive website was the first step. 

I have created a website for an imaginary pizza restaurant. To create this website I have used bootstrap to create a responsive navigation bar and responsive elements in the website. 

The website consists of the following:

1. Homepage with latest offers, opening hours and address
2. About page with a short history about the restaurant
3. Menu page listing all the items on the menu
4. Contact page which makes it possible to reserve a table online
